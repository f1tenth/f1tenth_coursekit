f1tenth - course kit
================================================

TESTING

Welcome to the official course kit documentation of `F1tenth <http://f1tenth.org/>`_. 

Here, you will find all the information needed to get your own f1tenth course running at your institution. This site only contains course materials. Information on how to build the cars and get started can be found `here <http://f1tenth.org/>`_.

This is not a public documentation as it contains solutions to the labs.

There are three parts to this documentation.

#. :ref:`Course Overview <doc_overview>` gives a brief overview of what the class is about and a snapshot of the materials that are presented. It also details the prerequisities needed and the syllabus.
#. :ref:`Course Sessions <doc_lecture_intro>` contains lecture materials (recordings and slides) and information on the final project.
#. :ref:`Assignments <doc_labs_intro>` has lab handouts and solutions.

For files of the f1tenth logo, see :ref:`Press <doc_logos>`
