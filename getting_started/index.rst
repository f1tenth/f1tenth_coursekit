There is enough material for a full semester course, however if you have a limited amount of time, here are some suggestions:

#. **4 Weeks** - Go through :ref:`Module A <doc_moduleA>` and :ref:`Module B <doc_moduleB>` and complete :ref:`Lab 1 <doc_lab1>`, :ref:`Lab 2 <doc_lab2>`, :ref:`Lab 3 <doc_lab3>`, and :ref:`Lab 4 <doc_lab4>`. This will be enough to get your vehicle race ready.

#. **10 Weeks (~1 Quarter)** - Go through :ref:`Module A <doc_moduleA>`, :ref:`Module B <doc_moduleB>`, :ref:`Module C <doc_moduleC>`, and :ref:`Module D <doc_moduleD>` and complete :ref:`Lab 1 <doc_lab1>`, :ref:`Lab 2 <doc_lab2>`, :ref:`Lab 3 <doc_lab3>`, :ref:`Lab 4 <doc_lab4>`, :ref:`Lab 5 <doc_lab5>`, and :ref:`Lab 6 <doc_lab6>`. This will teach you how to race efficiently.

#. **15 Weeks (~ 1 Semester)** - Go through all of the :ref:`Lectures <doc_lecture_intro>` and complete all of the :ref:`Labs <doc_labs_intro>`. This is the most comprehensive learning experience.
